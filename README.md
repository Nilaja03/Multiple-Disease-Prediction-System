# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System
This project is a Machine Learning Project using Python Programming Language.
There are four disease-prediction systems incorporated into this project using Support Vector Machine model and Linear Regression.
Once the models were created they were deployed using streamlit as a webapp.
This repository has 5 branches - main, Parkinson's-Disease-Prediction-System, Heart-Disease-Prediction-System, Diabetes-Prediction-System, Breast-Cancer-PredictionSystem.
Each branch is related to one particular disease prediction models.
Each branch consists of .csv file (dataset sheet), .savfile (saved model) and .ipynb file (source code).
The main branch consists of the deployment code using streamlit.
